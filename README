This code was to more accurately simulate mutations across the genome from CbASE cancer data, per cancer type 
outputs a mutated geneome which then split into pepeties and calculate new binding energy for.

Assumes only expressed genes produce peptides, as filters by gtex expression. 

Need to change as Javi will now output a table with all possible mutations and their binding energies.
So in step 4 instead of applying mutations to geneome, store position and mutation chosen in multinomial smapling.
Then look up in Javis table the binding energy only of the chnages and plot.

+change to use Javis improved transcripts 

NOTE: only draft of code, need to check more carefully when Javi is done with table.
